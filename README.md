# Stepping-Stones-Player

This is my version of bot which was to be made for competition of *Code Warriors*, an Technical Event of Annual Technical Fest **[Avishkar](http://avishkar.xyz/)** of **[MNNIT Allahabad](http://www.mnnit.ac.in/)**. In the competition, the code will basically work as the player in [Othello or Reversi Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). But the game was slightly changed by making the size of the board to 12*12 and also a change was added to it. 

In the code, algorithm used is minimax, implemented recursively with depth of 3. The code was not much efficient so it lost in the competition in semi-final round.
